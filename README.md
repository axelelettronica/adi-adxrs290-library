----
This is a library for the ST ADXRS290 component.
The ADXRS290 is a high performance MEMS pitch and roll (dual-axis in-plane) 
angular rate sensor (gyroscope) designed for use in stabilization applications.

Host control and result reading is performed using an SPI interface, no extra pin are required.

It was principally designed to work with the ADI board, but could
be easily adapt and use on every Arduino and Arduino Certified boards.
